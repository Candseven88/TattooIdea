According to the most common legend, this majestic creature lives for hundreds of years before bursting into flames and being reborn from its own ashes. This powerful symbolism makes phoenix tattoo designs particularly meaningful for people who have:\",\n    \n    \"- Overcome significant life challenges or hardships\",\n    \"- Experienced personal transformation or growth\",\n    \"- Survived illness or recovered from trauma\",\n    \"- Started a new chapter in life after difficult times\",\n    \"- Embraced change and personal renewal\",\n    \n    \"## Popular Phoenix Tattoo Styles\",\n    \n    \"Phoenix tattoo ideas can be designed in numerous artistic styles, each offering a unique aesthetic and feel:\",\n    \n    \"### 1. Traditional Japanese (Irezumi)\",\n    \n    \"Japanese phoenix tattoos (often called 'Hou-ou' or 'Fenghuang') feature vibrant colors, flowing lines, and dramatic compositions. These designs typically show the phoenix with elaborate tail feathers, surrounded by complementary elements like waves, clouds, or cherry blossoms.\",\n    \n    \"### 2. Realistic Phoenix Designs\",\n    \n    \"Realistic phoenix tattoos aim to create a lifelike representation of this mythical bird, with detailed feathers, expressive eyes, and natural-looking flames. These tattoo designs require skilled artists who can capture the dynamic nature of the phoenix in flight or rising from ashes.\",\n    \n    \"### 3. Minimalist Phoenix Tattoos\",\n    \n    \"For those who prefer subtlety, minimalist phoenix designs use clean, simple lines to capture the essence of the phoenix. These tattoos often feature geometric elements and can be particularly suitable for smaller placements like the wrist or behind the ear.\",\n    \n    \"### 4. Watercolor Phoenix Tattoos\",\n    \n    \"Watercolor phoenix tattoos blend vibrant colors that appear to flow like paint on canvas. This modern style creates a dreamy, artistic representation of the phoenix with splashes of color that seem to transcend the boundaries of traditional tattoo lines.\",\n    \n    \"### 5. Tribal Phoenix Designs\",\n    \n    \"Tribal phoenix tattoos incorporate bold, black patterns inspired by various cultural traditions. These designs focus on strong silhouettes and symbolic representations rather than detailed features.\",\n    \n    \"## Phoenix Sleeve Tattoo Designs for Complete Transformation\",\n    \n    \"The sleeve tattoo format offers an exceptional canvas for elaborate phoenix designs. A phoenix sleeve tattoo can wrap around your arm with dynamic movement, creating a stunning visual narrative of transformation. Consider these approaches for your phoenix sleeve tattoo:\",\n    \n    \"- **Full Arm Phoenix:** The bird's head can begin at the shoulder with wings spreading across the upper arm and tail feathers flowing down to the forearm\",\n    \"- **Rising Phoenix Sleeve:** Depict the phoenix emerging from flames at the wrist, rising up the forearm and arm in a powerful upward motion\",\n    \"- **Phoenix and Elements:** Combine your phoenix with complementary elements like fire, water, or celestial objects throughout the sleeve design\",\n    \"- **Story-Telling Sleeve:** Create a narrative sleeve showing the phoenix's complete cycle of death and rebirth\",\n    \n    \"Sleeve tattoos require significant commitment but offer the space needed to fully capture the majesty and symbolism of the phoenix in all its glory.\",\n    \n    \"## Angelic Phoenix Tattoo Ideas: Combining Celestial and Rebirth Symbolism\",\n    \n    \"For those seeking tattoo ideas with spiritual significance, combining angelic elements with phoenix imagery creates a powerful symbolic tattoo. These tattoo for angel designs merge the phoenix's rebirth symbolism with divine protection and guidance:\",\n    \n    \"- **Phoenix with Angel Wings:** Replace traditional phoenix wings with more angelic feathered wings for a celestial interpretation\",\n    \"- **Guardian Phoenix:** Design the phoenix in a protective posture, similar to guardian angel imagery\",\n    \"- **Phoenix with Halo:** Add a halo above the phoenix to emphasize its divine nature\",\n    \"- **Angel and Phoenix:** Create a design showing an angel releasing or communing with a phoenix\",\n    \"- **Phoenix Rising Toward Heaven:** Depict the phoenix rising upward toward rays of divine light\",\n    \n    \"These angelic phoenix tattoo designs are perfect for those who find meaning in both spiritual protection and personal transformation.\",\n    \n    \"## Best Placements for Phoenix Tattoo Ideas\",\n    \n    \"The phoenix's dynamic form makes it suitable for various body placements:\",\n    \n    \"### For Women:\",\n    \n    \"- **Back:** A full back piece allows for an elaborate phoenix design with extended wings and tail feathers.\",\n    \"- **Thigh:** The curved surface of the thigh provides an excellent canvas for a phoenix in flight.\",\n    \"- **Forearm:** A smaller phoenix design can wrap beautifully around the forearm.\",\n    \"- **Shoulder blade:** A medium-sized phoenix rising from ashes works well in this location.\",\n    \"- **Ribcage:** A vertical phoenix design can follow the natural curve of the ribs.\",\n    \n    \"### For Men:\",\n    \n    \"- **Chest:** A large phoenix can spread its wings across the chest for a powerful statement.\",\n    \"- **Full sleeve:** The phoenix can wrap around the arm, with flames and feathers creating a dynamic flow.\",\n    \"- **Back:** Similar to women, men can showcase a large, detailed phoenix across the back.\",\n    \"- **Calf:** A medium-sized phoenix works well on the muscular surface of the calf.\",\n    \"- **Side/Ribs:** A vertical phoenix design can create a striking side piece.\",\n    \n    \"## How Our AI Tattoo Generator Can Help Design Your Phoenix Tattoo\",\n    \n    \"Creating the perfect phoenix tattoo design can be challenging.

The mythical bird rises from its own ashes, representing transformation and the ability to emerge stronger from life's challenges.\",\n    \n    \"### How painful is a phoenix tattoo?\",\n    \"The pain level depends on the placement and size. Areas with thin skin or close to bone (like ribs or spine) will be more painful than fleshier areas like the outer arm or thigh. Larger phoenix designs requiring longer sessions may also involve more discomfort.\",\n    \n    \"### How much does a phoenix tattoo cost?\",\n    \"Costs vary widely based on size, detail, color, and the artist's experience. Small phoenix designs might start around $100-200, while elaborate sleeve or back pieces could range from $1,000 to several thousand dollars.\",\n    \n    \"### What colors work best for phoenix tattoos?\",\n    \"Traditional phoenix tattoos often feature reds, oranges, and yellows to represent fire. However, phoenixes can be designed in any color palette. Blue and purple phoenixes offer a unique twist, while black and gray designs provide elegant contrast and detail.\",\n    \n    \"## Conclusion: Finding Your Perfect Phoenix Tattoo\",\n    \n    \"Phoenix tattoo designs remain timeless for good reason – they combine striking visual appeal with profound symbolism. Whether you're drawn to the phoenix as a symbol of personal rebirth or simply appreciate its majestic beauty, there's a phoenix tattoo design perfect for your style and story.\",\n    \n    \"Remember that the best tattoo is one that resonates with your personal journey.

Traditional offers bold simplicity with limited colors, while neo-traditional provides more detail, dimension, and expanded color options while maintaining strong outlines. Look at healed examples of both styles to see which aesthetic appeals more to your personal taste.\",\n    \n    \"### Can different tattoo styles be combined effectively?\",\n    \"Yes, skilled artists often create fusion pieces that blend elements from different styles. Popular combinations include realistic portraits with geometric backgrounds, traditional imagery with Japanese-style backgrounds, or blackwork combined with fine line elements. Successful style fusion requires thoughtful planning and an artist experienced in both styles being combined.\",\n    \n    \"### How important is finding an artist who specializes in my chosen style?\",\n    \"Extremely important. Each tattoo style requires specific techniques and expertise. An artist who excels at realistic portraits may not have the same skill with traditional or Japanese work. Always review an artist's portfolio specifically for examples in your desired style, and look for healed work (6+ months old) to assess how their tattoos age.\",\n    \n    \"## Conclusion: Embracing Your Personal Tattoo Journey\",\n    \n    \"Finding your perfect tattoo style is a deeply personal journey that combines aesthetic preferences, symbolic meaning, and practical considerations.

Understanding these risks can help you make informed decisions and take appropriate precautions to ensure your tattoo experience is both beautiful and safe.`,\n\n    `## Understanding Legionnaires' Disease and Tattoos`,\n\n    `Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. These bacteria thrive in warm water environments and can cause infection when contaminated water droplets are inhaled into the lungs.`,\n\n    `### What is Legionnaires' Disease?`,\n\n    `Legionnaires' disease is characterized by symptoms including:`,\n    \n    `- High fever (often 104°F/40°C or higher)\n    - Cough, which might bring up mucus or blood\n    - Shortness of breath\n    - Chest pain\n    - Headaches and muscle aches\n    - Gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea\n    - Confusion or other mental changes`,\n\n    `While relatively rare, Legionnaires' disease can be life-threatening, particularly for people with weakened immune systems, chronic lung diseases, or those over 50 years old.`,\n\n    `### How Tattoos Could Potentially Relate to Legionnaires' Disease`,\n\n    `The connection between tattoos and Legionnaires' disease primarily involves water used in tattoo practices:`,\n\n    `- **Contaminated Water for Ink Dilution**: Some tattoo artists dilute ink with tap water, which could potentially contain Legionella bacteria if the water system is contaminated.\n    - **Cleaning Equipment**: If contaminated water is used to clean equipment that isn't properly sterilized afterward, there's a theoretical risk of exposure.\n    - **Cooling Systems in Tattoo Shops**: Poorly maintained air conditioning systems or water features in tattoo shops could harbor Legionella bacteria.`,\n\n    `While direct cases linking tattoos to Legionnaires' disease are extremely rare, the theoretical risk exists when proper hygiene and sterilization protocols aren't followed.`,\n\n    `## Understanding Lyme Disease and Tattoos`,\n\n    `Lyme disease is an infection caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted through the bite of infected black-legged ticks (deer ticks).`,\n\n    `### What is Lyme Disease?`,\n\n    `Lyme disease typically progresses through stages with varying symptoms:`,\n\n    `- **Early symptoms** (3-30 days after tick bite):\n      - Bull's-eye rash (erythema migrans)\n      - Fever and chills\n      - Fatigue\n      - Body aches\n      - Headache\n      - Swollen lymph nodes`,\n\n    `- **Later symptoms** (days to months after infection):\n      - Severe headaches\n      - Additional rashes\n      - Facial palsy (loss of muscle tone on one or both sides of the face)\n      - Joint pain and swelling, particularly in the knees\n      - Heart palpitations or irregular heartbeat\n      - Dizziness or shortness of breath\n      - Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord\n      - Nerve pain`,\n\n    `### How Tattoos Could Potentially Relate to Lyme Disease`,\n\n    `The connection between tattoos and Lyme disease is primarily environmental and circumstantial:`,\n\n    `- **Outdoor Tattoo Events**: Tattoo conventions or events held in outdoor settings, especially in wooded or grassy areas, could expose participants to ticks.\n    - **Tattoo Aftercare in Tick-Prone Areas**: Caring for a new tattoo while spending time outdoors in tick-heavy regions increases exposure risk.\n    - **Compromised Skin Barrier**: A fresh tattoo creates small wounds in the skin, which theoretically could provide an entry point for bacteria if a tick bite occurs near the tattooed area.`,\n\n    `It's important to note that Lyme disease is not directly transmitted through the tattooing process itself but could be a concern when tattoo-related activities take place in environments where ticks are prevalent.`,\n\n    `## Preventing Infections When Getting a Tattoo`,\n\n    `Taking proper precautions can significantly reduce your risk of infections, including rare ones like Legionnaires' disease and Lyme disease:`,\n\n    `### Choosing a Safe Tattoo Studio`,\n\n    `- **Verify Licensing**: Ensure the tattoo studio and artist are properly licensed according to local regulations.\n    - **Check Sterilization Practices**: Ask about their sterilization methods, including whether they use an autoclave for equipment.\n    - **Observe Hygiene Protocols**: Artists should wash hands thoroughly, wear fresh gloves, and use new, sterile needles for each client.\n    - **Ask About Water Sources**: Inquire whether sterile water is used for any dilution of inks.`,\n\n    `### Proper Tattoo Aftercare`,\n\n    `- **Follow Instructions**: Carefully follow all aftercare instructions provided by your tattoo artist.\n    - **Keep It Clean**: Wash the tattooed area gently with soap and water as directed.\n    - **Avoid Standing Water**: Stay away from swimming pools, hot tubs, and natural bodies of water until your tattoo is fully healed.\n    - **Monitor for Infection**: Watch for signs of infection, including increased redness, swelling, warmth, or discharge.`,\n\n    `### Outdoor Precautions (Particularly for Lyme Disease Prevention)`,\n\n    `- **Tick Awareness**: If you've recently gotten a tattoo, be extra cautious about tick exposure.\n    - **Use Repellent**: Apply EPA-registered insect repellents when outdoors.\n    - **Protective Clothing**: Wear long sleeves and pants when in wooded or grassy areas.\n    - **Check for Ticks**: Perform regular tick checks, especially after being outdoors.`,\n\n    `## When to Seek Medical Attention`,\n\n    `Contact a healthcare provider immediately if you experience:`,\n\n    `- Fever or chills\n    - Increasing pain, swelling, or redness around the tattoo\n    - Unusual discharge or pus from the tattoo\n    - Difficulty breathing or chest pain\n    - A rash that appears after getting a tattoo, especially a bull's-eye pattern\n    - Joint pain or neurological symptoms that develop after getting a tattoo`,\n\n    `Early treatment is crucial for both Legionnaires' disease and Lyme disease to prevent serious complications.`,\n\n    `## Reducing Risk with AI Tattoo Design`,\n\n    `One way to minimize health risks while still enjoying beautiful tattoo art is to thoroughly plan your design before visiting a tattoo studio.

These clever visual creations allow text to be read in multiple ways—typically when rotated 180 degrees—making them particularly popular for tattoos that represent duality, balance, or connections between two concepts or names. With the rise of digital tools, ambigram tattoo generators have made this once specialized art form accessible to everyone. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know about ambigram tattoo generators and how to create stunning designs for your next ink.\n\n## What Is an Ambigram?\n\nAn ambigram is a typographical design that can be read in multiple ways. The most common type is a rotational ambigram, which reads as one word or phrase right-side up and a different word or phrase when rotated 180 degrees. Other types include mirror ambigrams (readable when reflected), figure-ground ambigrams (where negative space forms letters), and chain ambigrams (where a series of words connect).\n\nFor tattoo enthusiasts, ambigrams offer a unique way to represent:\n- Two names (partners, children, family members)\n- Contrasting concepts (life/death, love/hate, strength/peace)\n- Words that have personal significance when viewed from different perspectives\n\n## The Rise of Ambigram Tattoo Generators\n\nTraditionally, creating ambigrams required specialized design skills and a deep understanding of typography. Artists like John Langdon (whose work was featured in Dan Brown's \"Angels & Demons\") and Scott Kim pioneered the field, creating ambigrams by hand through careful manipulation of letterforms.\n\nToday, ambigram tattoo generators use sophisticated algorithms and AI to:\n- Analyze the shapes of letters in different words\n- Find compatible letter pairings between words\n- Generate designs that maintain readability from multiple angles\n- Apply artistic styles that enhance the visual appeal while preserving function\n\n## How Ambigram Tattoo Generators Work\n\nModern ambigram generators employ several techniques to create readable dual-direction designs:\n\n### 1. Letter Mapping\n\nThe core of ambigram generation is letter mapping—determining which letters in the first word will transform into which letters in the second word when rotated. Some natural pairings include:\n- n/u (n rotated becomes u)\n- p/d (p rotated becomes d)\n- m/w (m rotated resembles w)\n- b/q (b rotated becomes q)\n\nFor letters without natural rotational pairs, generators use creative styling to make them readable from both directions.\n\n### 2. Style Application\n\nOnce the basic letter structure is determined, generators apply styling to enhance:\n- Readability from both directions\n- Aesthetic appeal and consistency\n- The chosen artistic style (Gothic, script, minimalist, etc.)\n\n### 3. Refinement and Balance\n\nAdvanced generators will:\n- Adjust letter spacing and connections for flow\n- Balance the visual weight of the design\n- Ensure that both readings are equally clear\n- Add decorative elements that enhance the design while maintaining functionality\n\n## Benefits of Using an Ambigram Tattoo Generator\n\n### 1. Accessibility\n\nCreating ambigrams manually requires significant artistic skill and understanding of typography. Generators make this art form accessible to everyone, regardless of design experience.\n\n### 2. Exploration and Iteration\n\nGenerators allow you to:\n- Try multiple word combinations quickly\n- Experiment with different styles\n- Make adjustments and refinements\n- Preview how designs might look as tattoos\n\n### 3. Inspiration\n\nEven professional tattoo artists often use generators as starting points for custom designs, helping to:\n- Visualize basic letter mappings\n- Understand structural possibilities\n- Generate ideas for stylistic approaches\n\n## Choosing the Right Ambigram Style for Your Tattoo\n\nThe style of your ambigram significantly impacts both its readability and how well it expresses your intended meaning. Popular styles include:\n\n### Gothic/Blackletter\n\nGothic ambigrams feature bold, dramatic letterforms with sharp angles and ornate details. This style works well for:\n- Names with strong personal significance\n- Concepts related to strength, legacy, or tradition\n- Designs that will be placed on larger areas of the body\n\n### Classic Script\n\nScript ambigrams use flowing, connected letterforms reminiscent of calligraphy or handwriting. This style is ideal for:\n- Romantic connections between names\n- Elegant, feminine designs\n- Words with personal emotional significance\n\n### Modern Minimalist\n\nMinimalist ambigrams strip letters down to their essential forms, creating clean, contemporary designs. Consider this style for:\n- Short, impactful words\n- Smaller tattoo placements\n- A subtle, understated aesthetic\n\n### Decorative\n\nDecorative ambigrams incorporate ornamental elements like flourishes, symbols, or patterns. These work well when:\n- You want to enhance the visual impact\n- The ambigram will be a centerpiece tattoo\n- You're combining the ambigram with other design elements\n\n## Tips for Creating the Perfect Ambigram Tattoo\n\n### 1. Choose Words Carefully\n\nNot all words make equally effective ambigrams. Consider:\n- Word length (shorter words typically work better)\n- Letter combinations (words sharing similar letters in reverse order work best)\n- Personal significance (ensure both words are meaningful to you)\n\n### 2. Prioritize Readability\n\nWhile artistic styling is important, the primary function of an ambigram is to be readable from multiple perspectives. Ensure that:\n- Both readings are clear\n- The design doesn't sacrifice legibility for style\n- The ambigram works at your intended tattoo size\n\n### 3. Consider Placement\n\nThe location of your ambigram tattoo affects how others will interact with it:\n- Forearm placements allow you to easily show the rotation effect\n- Chest or back placements work well for larger, more detailed designs\n- Wrist or ankle placements are good for simpler, more compact ambigrams\n\n### 4. Work with Your Tattoo Artist\n\nOnce you've generated a design you like:\n- Consult with a professional tattoo artist\n- Be open to refinements that improve the design\n- Consider how the design will age on skin (avoiding overly thin lines or cramped details)\n\n## From Digital Design to Skin: The Process\n\nAfter creating your ambigram design, the journey to getting it tattooed typically involves:\n\n1. **Refinement**: Working with your tattoo artist to optimize the design for skin\n2. **Sizing and Placement**: Determining the exact size and location on your body\n3. **Stencil Application**: Transferring the design to your skin as a guide\n4. **Tattooing**: The actual process of permanently applying the design\n5. **Healing and Maintenance**: Following proper care instructions to ensure the design heals properly and maintains its clarity\n\n## The Future of Ambigram Tattoo Generators\n\nAs technology advances, we're seeing exciting developments in ambigram generation:\n\n- **AI-Enhanced Design**: More sophisticated algorithms that better understand letter relationships and styling\n- **3D Previewing**: Tools that show how designs will look on different body parts\n- **Animation**: Digital tools that demonstrate the rotation effect before committing to ink\n- **Custom Font Integration**: The ability to use personalized typography in ambigram creation\n\n## Try Our Ambigram Tattoo Generator\n\nReady to create your own unique ambigram design?

Cross-reference AI outputs with experienced tattoo knowledge.\",\n\n    \"## Future Trends and Professional Development\",\n\n    \"The intersection of AI technology and tattoo artistry continues evolving rapidly, creating new opportunities for professional growth and creative expression.\",\n\n    \"### Emerging Technologies\",\n\n    \"**Augmented reality integration** will soon allow real-time tattoo visualization through smartphone cameras, enabling clients to see designs on their actual bodies in natural environments.\",\n\n    \"**Machine learning personalization** will adapt to individual artist styles, learning technique preferences and automatically applying signature aesthetic elements to new designs.\",\n\n    \"**Predictive healing simulation** will show how tattoos will appear at various stages of the healing process, helping clients understand the complete transformation journey.\",\n\n    \"### Professional Skill Development\",\n\n    \"As AI photo editing becomes standard in tattoo studios, developing proficiency with these tools becomes essential for competitive advantage. Investment in training and experimentation with platforms like [DigitalOcean's AI photo editing resources](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/ai-photo-editors) provides valuable technical foundation for implementing these technologies effectively.\",\n\n    \"**Recommended learning path:**\",\n    \"1. Master basic AI photo editing fundamentals\",\n    \"2. Explore tattoo-specific applications and workflows\",\n    \"3. Develop client consultation skills incorporating AI visualization\",\n    \"4. Build portfolio showcasing AI-enhanced design capabilities\",\n    \"5. Stay current with emerging AI technologies and applications\",\n\n    \"### Business Impact Considerations\",\n\n    \"Studios implementing AI photo editing report significant improvements in:\",\n    \"- **Client satisfaction rates** due to accurate expectation setting\",\n    \"- **Design approval speed** through rapid iteration capabilities\", \n    \"- **Revenue per client** by facilitating more complex, detailed designs\",\n    \"- **Artist efficiency** by reducing manual mockup time\",\n    \"- **Portfolio quality** enhancing marketing and social media presence\",\n\n    \"## Conclusion and Next Steps\",\n\n    \"AI photo editing represents a fundamental shift in how tattoo designs are conceived, refined, and visualized. This technology empowers both artists and clients to explore creative possibilities with unprecedented precision and confidence.\",\n\n    \"The key to successful implementation lies in viewing AI as a powerful enhancement to traditional artistic skills rather than a replacement for creative vision. When used thoughtfully, these tools can elevate design quality, improve client communication, and streamline workflows without compromising artistic integrity.\",\n\n    \"For tattoo artists ready to embrace this technological evolution, the path forward involves systematic exploration of AI capabilities, gradual workflow integration, and continuous learning as the technology advances. The investment in time and resources pays dividends through improved client satisfaction, enhanced creative possibilities, and competitive advantage in an increasingly digital marketplace.\",\n\n    \"Whether you're a seasoned artist looking to modernize your design process or a newcomer seeking efficient workflows, AI photo editing tools offer transformative potential for elevating your tattoo artistry to new heights.\",\n\n    \"---\",\n\n    \"### Related Reading\",\n\n    \"- [How AI is Revolutionizing Tattoo Design: The Future of Ink](/blog/ai-tattoo-generator-revolution)\",\n    \"- [Finding Your Perfect Tattoo Style: A Guide to Popular Designs](/blog/finding-perfect-tattoo-style)\",\n    \"- [Creative Hand Tattoo Ideas and Designs](/blog/creative-hand-tattoos)\"\n  ],\n  relatedPosts: getRelatedPosts(slug)\n};\n\nexport default aiPhotoEditorGuide; "],"names":[],"mappings":";;;AACA;;AAEA,MAAM,OAAO;AAEb,MAAM,qBAA+B;IACnC,IAAI;IACJ,OAAO;IACP,SAAS;IACT,OAAO;IACP,UAAU;IACV,MAAM;IACN,MAAM;IACN,QAAQ;IACR,MAAM;QAAC;QAAmB;QAAiB;QAAiB;QAAY;KAAuB;IAC/F,SAAS;QACP;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QACA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QAEA;QACA;QACA;KACD;IACD,cAAc,CAAA,GAAA,wHAAA,CAAA,kBAAe,AAAD,EAAE;AAChC;uCAEe","debugId":null}},
